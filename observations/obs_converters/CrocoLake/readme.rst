CrocoLake 
=========

This observation converter reads data from the CrocoLake, which is a database of oceanographic
observations developed and maintained in the framework of the NSF-sponsored project
`CROCODILE <https://github.com/CROCODILE-CESM>`__ (CESM Regional Ocean and Carbon 
cOnfigurator with Data assimilation and Embedding).

More details about CrocoLake can be found on the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution 
Biogeochemical Ocean Observing and Modeling Lab (`boom-lab <https://github.com/boom-lab>`__)
with examples provided in `crocolake-python <https://github.com/boom-lab/crocolake-python>`__.

The converter requires the `crocolakeloader <https://github.com/boom-lab/crocolakeloader>`__ 
python package to be installed and the location of the CrocoLake database to be specified.
